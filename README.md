BananaInventoryAPI

What is this?

BananaInvAPI allows developers to easily create dynamic GUIs that can enchance their plugin and add easy customization. This allows them to create custom menus, virtual storage, and more. BananaInvAPI is still in development, so don't get too mad if this does not have everything you wanted.
